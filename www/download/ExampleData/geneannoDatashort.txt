Based on their distribution patterns, some members of this family are believed to be involved in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division. This gene includes 2 alternatively spliced transcripts encoding 2 different isoforms. The larger isoform is a DEAD box protein with RNA helicase activity. It may participate in melting of DNA:RNA hybrids, such as those that occur during transcription, and may play a role in X-linked gene expression. It contains 2 copies of a double-stranded RNA-binding domain, a DEXH core domain and an RGG box. The RNA-binding domains and RGG box influence and regulate RNA helicase activity. The smaller isoform is a lymphocyte granule protein. It lacks RNA-binding domains and DEXH core domain, but contains an RGG box, which may render this isoform RNA binding function."

This process is mediated by a receptor that recognizes, and binds the tetrapeptide-containing protein, and returns it to the ER.  In yeast, the sorting receptor encoded by a single gene, ERD2, is a seven-transmembrane protein.  Unlike yeast, several human homologs of the ERD2 gene, constituting the KDEL receptor gene family, have been described.  KDELR3 was the third member of the family to be identified, and it encodes a protein highly homologous to KDELR1 and KDELR2 proteins.

CALLA is a glycoprotein that is particularly abundant in kidney, where it is present on the brush border of proximal tubules and on glomerular epithelium. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence is identical to that of human membrane-associated neutral endopeptidase, also known as enkephalinase. NEP cleaves peptides at the amino side of hydrophobic residues and inactivates several peptide hormones including glucagon, enkephalins, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, and bradykinin. The CALLA gene, which encodes a 100-kD type II transmembrane glycoprotein, exists in a single copy of greater than 45 kb which is not rearranged in malignancies expressing cell surface CALLA. The CALLA gene spans more than 80 kb and is composed of 24 exons. The 5' untranslated region of CALLA is alternatively spliced, resulting in four separate mRNA transcripts.
